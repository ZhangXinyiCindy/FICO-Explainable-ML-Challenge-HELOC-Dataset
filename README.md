# FICO-Explainable-ML-Challenge-HELOC-Dataset
Course work of "STAT3612 Statistical Machine Learning" that uses the same dataset HELOC as the FICO Explainable Machine Learning Challenge.
# Dataset Details
This competition focuses on an anonymized dataset of Home Equity Line of Credit (HELOC) applications made by real homeowners. A HELOC is a line of credit typically offered by a bank as a percentage of home equity (the difference between the current market value of a home and its purchase price). The customers in this dataset have requested a credit line in the range of $5,000 - $150,000. The fundamental task is to use the information about the applicant in their credit report to predict whether they will repay their HELOC account within 2 years. This prediction is then used to decide whether the homeowner qualifies for a line of credit and, if so, how much credit should be extended. /n
The data are stored in file "HelocData.csv", while some descriptions are stored in "HelocDataDict.xlsx".
